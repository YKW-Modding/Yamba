# Yamba
A Yo-Kai Watch position editor. Provide it with an encrypted .yw save file and it can change the map you are in, as well as your X, Y and Z coordinates. Only tested with YKW1 3DS.

**NOTE: The game snaps you back onto the floor when changing the Y position. Keep this in mind!**

## Usage

1. Click on Code -> Download ZIP
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run main.py
4. Enter your options, then rename output.yw to gameX.yw (X being the save file number) and put it into the game
